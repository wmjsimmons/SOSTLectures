SOST201--14Nov2023Lecture

The background of secession--again, the old tension between slavery and liberty, in the various senses of those terms:
--The Southern fear of abrogations of liberty, of feeling enslaved, that animated how the South (and America generally for that matter) engaged the 18th century/Revolutionary Era
--Liberty, connected to property, has for Southerners the need to protect their interests in enslaved labor. (Note how the geographic and climatological realities of the 17th century had now, 250 years later, produced a context in which this sort of labor was absolutely essential for the South's ability to participate in the global economy on a profitable footing and avoid a sense of colonial-style exploitation)
--Slavery, understood for a generation after the Revolution as antithetical to the very principles of liberty yet something so deeply embedded in the socioeconomic order that getting rid of it was essentially impossible, had in the subsequent generation become a proxy for understanding the South's very notion of liberty. As increasing Northern eocnomic, demographic, and political might decentered the South's place in America and, by the 1820s, put the Northeast firmly in the center of American socioeconomic and political might, slavery became the one thing that united the South's myriad, and often conflicting, political cultures and socioeconomic interests. If the South as a region was to maintain the liberty that was so important to it and that it had inherited as part of the broader Anglo-American tradition that was over 1,000 years old--if it was not to lose the very idea of self-determination that the South, alongside the rest of the American colonies, had fought for during the Revolution, the region must then unify. Slavery becomes the thing that unifies the region into a coherent whole, thus transitioning from "necessary evil" to "positive good".
--Now, in the present generation, Southerners feel their liberty all the more threatened, with direct threats to the institution of slavery (and by it, threats to their sense of liberty--of being able to use their property as they so desire), with the political headwinds changing so as to seemingly limit and box in their sense of self-determination, with aboltionists taking moral stances on the ending of slavery with no consideration of the socioeconomic chaos that Southerners had every reason to believe would follow the demise of the institituion, of fears of revolutionary bloodshed stoked by things like John Brown's violence (as the old saying goes, "one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist") and Hinton Helper's Impending Crisis, the rise of sectionally-aligned political parties since the end of the age of Jackson, and with longstanding worries over economic exploitation of the South as demonstrated by the now decades-old debates over tariffs, free trade, and the varying economic needs of agricultural and industrial societies--all of these coalesced in a moment wherein the South sees, in the election of Lincoln, an announcement that it has become the rump political region it has feared becoming for over a generation. And thus the region, to protect its "liberty" (including its right to slave property) from the "slavery" of being denied self-determination, to protect its socioeconomic interests when it sensed its political power was now at its nadir, the South broke with the Union in a way that, to their minds, was aligned with what their grandfathers had done in their break with the British. 

The nature of secession:
--While now understood as an illegality, secession itself was a complex issue before 1865; we have seen much of this already.
--Arguably, the Revolution was a secession, not truly a revolution; a Colombian once told me that Latin American people refer to it as "El Secessiano Americano" because, unlike the revolutions of Simon Bolivar, ours was not truly revolutionary. Instead, it was a break from *a* government to form a new government that is a natural evolution of the previous, rather than a true overthrowing of government.
--The Constitution does not make explicit a notion of union as perpetual, nor does it even make clear what this union is--a nation, or something else (the US is vs. the US are; the draft preamble of the Constitution)
--The experience of New England during the generation of Southern dominance of the US suggests that secession was, at least for some, a means of protecting the interests--the liberty--of one section when it seemed poised to be dominated by another. We have various examples and evidences of New Englanders understanding secession as such during the early years of the 19th century. To suggest that this was the normative, or even the mainstream, form of New England thought as regarding secession and union in this era would be, at best, misleading, but it does illustrate that the very idea of union was to some extent always fluid and contested by the first few generations of Americans--and that ideas of secession and union are often connected to one's political power vis-a-vis others within that union.

Secession thus at least an open question, along with ideas like nullification and interposition, during this era. The inescapable question of the first eight decades of the American Republic is what is the relationship of the parts to the center--of the states to the federal government--of where the locus of power in the republic exists (states or centeral government)--of the foundation of the Constitution itself (in the people as an aggregate national body or in the states). As power dynamics change and geopolitical, economic, and demographic alterations bring some parts of the country to power and others to anxities about their ability to self-determine/protect their liberty, this question is expressed and explored in various ways.  

For a generation now, the South's place in the Union had been a vexed one, as the nullificaiton crisis showed. But, importantly, the Calhounite doctrines of Nullification and interposition--as well as their predecessors in the Jeffersonian Principles of '98--were inesecapably pro-union, nationalist propositions. For all of the idea of Calhoun being the father of secession--something that Northerners clearly in their post-War writings about Calhoun think (countless memoirs of Northerners traveling to Charleston during Reconstruction include a pilgrimige to Calhoun's grave and an inevitable remark about him being the father of secession)--in many ways the Jeffersonian and Calhounite ideas are means by which the South (or, for that matter, *any* section or state) could have its rights and liberties protected within a broader union. Of course, these principles could also, if taken to their logical end, possibly also destroy the very foundations of union itself, rendering union ineffective and rolling back the protections to liberty the federal constitution sought to inaugurate. Secession was an entirely different solution, one that said that the benefits of union no longer protected liberty or, stated differently, that the benefits of union protected *only* one group and not others.

It was on the issue of slavery that this question of the purpose and good of union would turn most decisively at mid-century. Longstanding inter-sectional tensions between North and South over political power, tarriffs, internal improvements, and any number of issues already explored this term primed the pump, so to speak, yet slavery would take all of these issues and magnify them. In the aftermath of the debate over the annexation of Texas and, especially, the Mexican War, discussions of slavery fell into predictably sectional lines.
--The North saw everywhere a conspiratorial "Slave Power" that sought to expand the damnable institution into not only the territories, but also into the free states. Abraham Lincoln himself participated in this conspiratorial thinking in his famous 1858 "House Divided" speech; yet, historians are divided on whether or not Lincoln truly believed in this shadowy conspiracy to force slavery beyond its borders or if this were merely part of a calculated political move to discredit his great political rival, Stephen A. Douglas, who advocated for popular soveriengty. For some in the North, Slave Power sought to keep blacks from ever being full Americans--but these were an overwhelming minority, as most in the North had no concern for blacks as fellow citizens or, in some cases, even as people. Thus, for mos tin the North, the idea of the "Slave Power" was a means by which for some in the North to decry what it saw as disproportionate power held by the South, a shadowy conspiracy that allowed the South to spread slavery and to advance *its* interests in opposition to that of the rest of the county. Others saw "Slave Power" not so much as a shadowy conspiracy for Southern power but rather simply as a reality that showed that, whenever another compromise or political maneuver over slavery presented itself (as it had in 1820 and 1850, as well as SCOTUS decisions like Dred Scott), the rights of white Americans and Northerners' ideas of self-determination were threatened. Still others, particularly associated with the "Free Soil" Party of the late 1840s/early 50s, saw Slave Power as a threat to white farmers; by bringing slavery into the territories and non-slaveholding states, opportunities would be limited to white farmers who would struggle to compete with planters, and there would be an introduciton of an aristocratic element that would be contrary to the ideas of Jacksonian democracy that were dominant in the West. There was also a fair amount of racial animus in this "free soil" movement as well, with opposition to the expansion of slavery into the territories (and the fears, conspiratorial or otherwise, of free states being forced to become slave states) partially being driven by a desire to exclude blacks from these places: 1844, 49, and 57 infamously saw "black exclusion laws" passed in the territory and later state of Oregon; in 1853, Illinois State Representative John A. Logan (who later was on W.T. Sherman's staff and who came up with the idea of Memorial Day as an official holiday) was a primary author of a "black code" for Illinois which prohibited blacks from living in the state; these codes would remain in effect until after the Civil War and black civil rights would remain heavily curtailed in IL throuought the rest of the 19th century.
--The South saw in all the North did an attempt to radically undermine its own society and disrupt its economic life, create chaos and even bloodshed within it, and, by limiting the expansion of slavery beyond the states where it already existed, effectively curtail political power for the South on the national stage. Abolitionism was associated not just with the end of slavery, but with radical politics generally, strange new religious movements, and a general sense of undermining traditions and the very principles on which not only Southern, but Anglo-American civilization more broadly was based. 

The issue of slavery thus becomes a proxy through which ideas of self-determination and the nature of union itself are filtered for *both* the North and the South. Yes, the South seceded over slavery; but if merely *preserving* slavery in the abstract was the South's reason for seceding--that is, for declaring Union no longer sufficiently useful to protect liberty and allow for self-determination--then surely the proposed constitutional amendment put forth by Rep. Thomas Corwin of Ohio would have assuaged such fears. That proposed amendment was supported by outgoing President Buchanan, who took the ceremonial and superfluous step of affixing his signature to it, and was also publically supported by President-Elect Lincoln. The text of the amendment reads as follows:

No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.

That amendment gained little traction, receiving ratification from only five states (KY, OH, RI, MD, IL) and failed to entice a single seceded state back into the Union. 

Southern secession, then, was not merely about the protection of slavery in the abstract. After all, if the Corwin amendment had been ratified, what happens? The South keeps slavery but, in all likelihood, the region slides into the exact kind of secondary status in the Union it had feared itself as occupying for the previous generation; thus, from the Southern perspective, even if the Union--with an amended constitution--specifically protected slavery, the South's liberty, the South's sense of self-determination are thus severely compromised.  Secession seems like the only reasonable solution in that context. 

LOOK AT DAVIS'S SPEECH IN THIS CONTEXT--Note how he repudiates nullifcation as an abrogation of constitutional duty; the only way to get out of such things is to exit the constitutional union. 
--The sovereignty of the states; secession thus downstream of the Jeffersonian tradition while nevertheless deviating from its main current (nullification/interpsotion) as expressed earlier in the 19th century. 
--The ideas of liberty; its continuation, the "rights handed down to us by our fathers"; what the South is doing, in this perspective, not a break from the past but a natural evolution of it, continued alongside and within it.
--The "compact" idea of Union; we have already seen this. This thus remains in the South. Secession thus arguably born of a particular interpretation of union with roots going back to the revolution.
--Does Davis thus anticipate violence? What does it seem like he thinks will happen? 

Of course, as Thomas elegantly shows, secession was no one thing in the South; there were multliple ideas of secession, multiple individuals who saw secession as necessary, but from very different perspectives.

1--Fire-Eaters; radicals who see the conflict in civilizatonal terms and the irreconcilable nature of North and South *as cultures*; they ulitmately make a lot of noise (and understandably frustrate and exacerbate Northern feelings of threats to liberty) but have very little in the way of actual power.
2--Strong Secessionists; younger, often truculent, wealthy slaveholders who see the rise of the GOP as directly threatening their economic interests. They, more than any other group, are the nursemaids of secession and those who succeed in actually getting the South out of the Union, but have little power in the formation of the CSA proper, much to their frustration. If the Fire Eaters are the ideologues, these are the believers in Southern nationhood, and yet they are largely excluded from crafting the Southern nation.
3--Cooperationists; these were the moderates who saw debates over slavery as holistic issues of political power. They saw leaving as perhaps necessary, but it needed to be done *not* unilitararally; states must secede togehter, and secession was not somethign to be taken lightly. This the group that eventually comes to power during the Montgomery provisional congress and shapes the Confederate nation.

What, then, do the moderates actually produce in Montgomery? See you comments on page 66.
