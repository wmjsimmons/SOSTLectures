Historians and literary scholars like to point out how much we rely on each others' work, and how poorly we understand the other's area of study. Historians lament that literary scholars misunderstand history and misapply history to their readings of literature, whilist literary scholars groan at historians' wooden readings of works of literature as part of their historical work. I note that to begin today, because I have a bit of contention with how CTC treat William Gilmore Simms.

Thus, in a chapter I didn't have us read--Chapter 11--we see a few statements about Simms. The general assessment in the middle of that chapter is actually quite good, but on page 258, our textbook notes (read that paragraph). There are multiple problems with the assessment leveled by CTC here (discuss these).

Simms was definitively not the immense critic of the South that later generaions of writers would come to be in the 1870s/80s, to say nothing of the writers of the 20th century, like William Faulkner and Zora Neale Hurston, who write fiction that, while celebrating the South, is often devastatingly critical of it, too. The South's understanding of itself was simply too under-developed in the 1830s, 40s, and 50s--the time of Simms's so-called "Sacred Circle" of Southern intellectuals--to develop a robust critical reassessment of the legend of the place, much like what we see someone like Hawthorne doing with the legend of Puritan New England. We discussed that last time. 

With that in mind, let's return to "Caloya." A story, yes, that is in some ways a silly melodrama. Yet there's more here, more that we started to unpack, more that reveals that, even for someone like Simms who, per our textbook authors, "had a sacred duty to the South--to understand it, to explain it, even to defend it, but not to criticize it or question its fundamental organization," even in those writers, we find a more sophisticated presentation of the region *as its regional consciousness was being developed* than such statements may lead us to believe.

[return to discussion of Caloya]

This story points us to both some aspects of the legends of the Old South and, at the same time, an idea of just how complex the social order of the region was. With that in mind, let us turn to a consideration of the economic and social order of the antebellum South; note we are not going to be discussing slavery in depth--that will wait another couple of weeks--but will touch on it some. Rather, we are going to look at what the economic order looks like. On what does the region's economy depend? How does geography shape this? Chapter 8 of our textbook does a solid job of exploring this, so I'd like to dig a bit more into the demographic situation of the South, and how it is connected to the economic and geographic facts of the region in this era.

First, as our textbook notes, the classic tripartite structure of planters, poor whites, and enslaved blacks bears little resemblance to the actual reality of the antebellum South's social order--it was much more complicated, as something like "Caloya" in its own way suggests.

Yes, there were planters--but not every white who was not a planter was a "poor white." Further, not all Blacks were enslaved. So then--what did the social order of the Old South actually like?

First, we must make sense of the planter class. The plantocracy dominated Southern society--what was its makeup? Was it numerically dominant? How widespread was slaveholding?
--An analysis of the 1850 census shows that there were 1.25M white families in the South at that time. Of those, only 347,000 owned slaves. That is, roughly 3/4 of Southern White families were not directly involved in slavery--I say directly because many of them would have tangential relationships to the system, via renting slaves, having some connection to the slave economy in the form of being overseers or some other indirect economic involvement in the system. Still, the fact remains that 3/4 of Southern families did not directly hold Black Southerners as slaves.
--Of the 25% of slaveholding familes, over 70% of them held ownership of less than ten enslaved Blacks; this was the large class of yeoman farmers, small-scale landowners whose agricultural labor provided them with their own food and also grew a small amount of commodity crops for sale on the open market (a market they gained access to via relationships with larger planters who faciliated the sale of their small amounts of product through packaging it in with their large crops--and taking a fee for so doing--or of "factors," corporations that brought together the crops of multiple small farmers to sell as a consolidated whole, while also taking a fee for so doing). Typically, these farmers would work side-by-side with, and often sleep under the same roof with, their slaves. 
--While more than ten slaves suggested one was on the way to wealth, the "elite" really only began when someone held more than 50 slaves; fewer than 8,000 Southerners possessed that many enslaved laborers. The truly elite were those with 100 or more; only 1,800 people held between 100-499, and only 11 owned more than 500. Nathaniel Heyward of Beaufort County owned more than 1,800 slaves, with a net worth at his death of $2M--which roughly translates to about $70M in today's money.
--Thus, while slaveholding was widespread, the fantasy of the entire South as being dotted by large, palatial estates where hundreds of enslaved Blacks labored is just that--a fantasy. This was always the exception, not the norm, in the antebellum South.

While the plantation class's spread may be much smaller than we may imagine from our perspective nearly two centuries later, they did dominate the social, political, economic, and intellectual life of the region. A minority they may have been, the large planters nevertheless shaped the South. Further, beyond onwership of slaves, these individuals controlled the best lands of the region. In the Deep South of the antebellum era, 1% of the White populaton received 45% of the average annual income, due to their ownership of the best lands--cotton was, indeed, king.

But who were the planters? They were not the romantic aristocrats of legend--that idea was largely a literary creation. On the whole, even the largest and wealthiest planters were first and foremost businessmen, running their plantations with the same eye to profits and efficienct management of labor and resources as any Northern industrialist.  Further, the antebellum era sees the interior South open up--central and west Georgia, AL, MS, TN, etc. The great plantations west of the Fall Line were typically not established by the old families of the Carolina and Georgia Lowcountry or the Tidewater of Virginia (though, to be clear, movement from the eastern to the western portions of the South was common, even amongst more established families as cotton and tobacco exhausted the soil). On the whole, the interior South's plantocracy were originally low-status Whites--whether immigrants, small-scale farmers, or even some very lucky White trash--who were self-made men, turning a little money into a couple of slaves, which then produced more money, which allowed for purchasing more slaves and more land, and so on and so forth. Thus, most planters were not, in fact, aristocratic gentlemen, but rather exemplars of a peculiar version of the American dream of self-made men.

Nevertheless, the legend of all planters as genteel aristocrats persisted. Of course, these self-made planters themselves reveled in the fantasy, as it gave them prestige and connected them at least tangentially with the established elites of coastal Carolina and Virginia. Surprisingly (or maybe not so surprisingly), many in the North also went along with this legend. Rather than try to discredit or undermine the legend, Northerners leaned into it, contributing to its growth as both something they sometimes admired and, especially as time moved forward and the sectional conflict heated up, evidence that the South was an aristocratic, lazy, anti-democratic place that was, in short, fundamentally anti-American.

Small as they may have been and with a legend that often did not match the reality, the plantation served an important role for the region, granting it a central instituion that created a sense of unity across all strata of the White South. Common whites could aspire to become planters (as many planters had been common whites just a few years before); yeoman uninterested in becoming planters found utility in the plantation, as it gave them a means by which to access the commodity markets and, with the slave-lease system, access to the labor of enslaved Blacks they could otherwise not afford; the merchant classes obviously enjoyed the wealth and disposable income produced by the plantation; further, the plantation class, in aspiring to live up to the fantasy of their own selves, did come to promote practices of hospitality, manners, and courtesy that would become hallmarks of Southern society, and even when these characteristics were not practiced in fact, the idea of them shaped Sotuhern self-conception. Finally, Northern antagonism towards the plantation helped solidify Southern loyalty to it, as the plantation itself became a byword for the socioeconomic and political interests for White Southerners of all social classes. 

Enough of the planters; who were the common whites?
--"Common" here does not mean "poor." As already noted, many of these "common whites" were not poor white trash, but rather solid, if middling, yeoman farmers. Recall what we've said about them already, but add to this a fierce independence and sense of self-reliance, a jealous guardianship of their own liberties, a highly developed sense of honor--in other words, these people had many of the characteristics of their borderlander ancestors from the other side of the ocean.
--Geography affected how the yeomanry lived in the South, and even which common whites had access to becoming prosperous, stable yeoman. Further, geography also affected how some yeoman could become wealthy planters and others could not. Parts of the Piedmont--in say, parts of Georgia and western SC--the climactic conditions were right for growing cotton, but the sloping hills limited how large the cotton fields could be. Further, such areas often lacked access to navigable--as oppossed to whitewater--rivers that would allow for ready delivery of what cotton they could grow to market. As such, much of the Carolina and Georgia Piedmont would never see the development of a plantocracy. Here, small, productive farms that could provide for families thrived, with small farming communities turning into bustling, if humble, towns to support these farmers ("cotton factors" would exist in these towns, giving these farmers some access to the cotton market and thus helping them gain some tangible wealth as well). The lack of plantation-quality geography in this land made slavery much less common here; counties west and north of the Fall Line would always have less Black residents than those east and south of it.

Poor White Trash
--If not all common whites were poor, poor white trash nevertheless did exist and their lives were typically very, very hard. Shoved to the margins, both metaphorically and geographically, poor whites occupied a vexed place in antebellum Southern society. Called by a variety of names--hillbillies, crackers, sand-hillers, rag-tag-and-bob-tailers, squatters, and more--these individuals lived lives that were, in material conditions, often worse off than many enslaved Blacks, at least in terms of their food and housing. According to the historian Francis B. Simkins, "descriptions of [poor whites'] ignorance, poverty, filth, lack of ambition, and misshapen forms would hardly be believed were the evidence not confirmed by reliable [and varied] observers from [the Northerner] Frederick L. Olmsted and [the Missouri liberal] Mark Twain to [Southern] proslavery apologists." While many in the 19th century used the same kinds of pseudoscience that produced "scientific" studies of the racial inferiority of Blacks to try to understand Poor White Trash, the conditions of Poor White Trash seemed to be easily explainable with simple answers. Poor Whites' lives and position were the result of their being the least capable and least talented people of the Southern backcountry, who were thus pushed to the swamps, sandhills, and pine savannahs by the spread west. Of little natural talent or intelligence, with access only to the worst geographic places in the South, disconnected by being isolated in these places that other, more talented Southerners did not want,  poor Whites had little access to opportunity. Further, the wretched lands they resided on were often disease-ridden and their soils produced little in the way of vegetables, and what did grow was often nutritionally deficient. Disease and nutritional deficienty further contributed to their problems, hurting both the physical and intellectual development of their children, setting up the true poor white trash for generational hardships. 

Geography and Southern Demographics:
--U.B. Phillips's classic Life and Labor in the Old South describes the geographic situation well, taking Georgia as typical for the South as a whole: "Georgia was broadly banded; a strip of sea island cotton and rice plantations on the coast, with a dense [black] population; the pine barrens [more commonly known as 'wiregrass Georgia'] with sparse whites and very few slaves; the main cotton belt spreading southwesterly across the state with mingled farms and planations and the [blacks] more numerous than the whites; the upper piedmont with [yeoman] farmers predominating; and the mountains with of course no plantations and virtually no slaves 

Urban South/merchant class
--While the South of this era was primarily, and even ovewhelmingly, rural, a vibrant merchant class existed in the South's cities and towns; in many ways, this merchant class existed to support the fundamentally rural character of the South, providing both farmers and planters with access to markets, goods and services, and luxuries that directly helped and indirectly complemented the needs and desires of rural Southeners. A significant number of this merchant class were Jews, who became a cornerstone of the financial and mercantile life of Southern cities and small towns into the 21st century.

Free Blacks
--Finally, while the overwhelming majority of Black Southernres of this era were enslaved (approx. 4M enslaved Blacks in the South in 1860), there there were about 250,000 free Blacks in the South that same year, with about half of these in VA and MD (thus does DC unsurprisingly become the epicenter of Black intellectual, political, and economic life for the last few decades of the 19th century).
--Based on what we've talked about concerning Revolutionary-generation Southerners' conflicted attitude over slavery, it should be unsurprising that this generation freed significant numbers of their slaves; some freed their slaves while they were alive, but others freed them in their wills. On the whole, the discomfort that Revolutionary-era Southerners had with slavery led to manumission at rates that saw the number of Free Blacks in the south *double* between 1790 and 1810. However, the Lousiana Purchase--and with it, the opening of the Cotton Kingdom--and, just a few years later, the Nat Turner revolt, doomed this effort; slave manumissions became increasingly rare.
--However, many enslaved Blacks were able to buy their freedom during the decades prior to the Civil War. Large numbers of slaves, particularly slave men, learned skilled trades during their enslavement. Skilled labor was often more economically beneficial to slave holders by renting out this labor rather than keeping it bottled up on the plantation, particularly when plantations were a reasonable distance from a town or city where such labor was in high demand. Often, the enslaved tradesman would be allowed to keep a portion of the earnings he made from his labor (with the lion's share going to his master). This was a typical way in which some slaves used their skills to, overtime, save up sufficient funds to purchase their freedom and, in many cases, that of their family members. 
--Many free blacks went on to become important to the life of Southern cities and towns, with some trades--like barbering--being almost exclusively Black. Thus, while most Free Blacks in the antebellum era were essentially small-scale farmers or small-time skilled laborers who had to obey regulations about their behavior (regulations that were sometimes stricter on paper than in practice and that were often inconsistently applied), some became business owners and entrepeneurs, some prosperous farmers, with even a small number becoming slave-holding plantation owners themselves (Martin Donato of St. Landry Parish, LA owned nearly 90 slaves; tax reports from Charleston in 1860 list 130 Free person of color who, between them, owned nearly 400 enslaved workers).
