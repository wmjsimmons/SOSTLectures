Our (admittedly somewhat messy--I was brain-scrambled by dealing with my kids here on campus) overview of how we have to understood slavery pointed us to what I think is the correct interpretation of the institution in the abstract: Slavery is simultaneoulsy a system of labor and a system of social control. This is, on the one hand, obvious, but is still something we need to consider carefully. Slavery existing as both of these things creates significant consequences for both the slaveholding and enslaved classes--as well as those more tangentially connected to, or even those disconnected from, the system--and how they interact with one another, how each is shaped by the other. Remember, one of the key differences between slavery in the South and how slavery was practiced in the Carribbean and, to some extent, in Brazil is how intimate the interactions between the masters and slaves were in the US Southern context. Rather than mass slaveholders living far away from the bulk of their slaves, Southern whites tended to live shoulder-to-shoulder with their enslaved laborers. Of course, the large slaveholders depended on overseers and enslaved "drivers" to hierarchically manage their slaves and keep them organized into what are called "gang labor" groupings, so we should not hear what I'm saying and think that a large slaveholder would *personally*interact with every single slave; in cases of large numbers of slaves, he'd probably not know most of them by sight or name. Yet Soutehrn slaveholders were deeply interested and involved in the lives of their slaves, for both economic and social-control reasons. This constant interaction of both classes has consequences for the South on the whole.

Looking back at Genovese's arguments, he suggests the following important ideas about Southern slaveholding, which will then lead us :

--THE SLAVEHOLDER'S DILEMMA: Slaveholding organically developed into a culture particular, and even peculiar to, the South. The economic needs of slavery meant that the slaveholding "oppressor" class (recall the Genovese is arguing from a Marxist theoretical lens, so the language of oppressor and oppressed classes are inevitable to his argument) needing to exploit labor from the "oppressed" enslaved class as maximally and efficiently as possible. Yet the intimacy of the relationship played upon the humanity of the slaveholders, not allowing them to see the slaves as merely laboring *objects*. This leads to a paternalistic understanding of the institution by slaveholders. Paternalism does not mean *benign* by any means--as we will see with Douglass, things which the master may have understood as an appropriately paternalistic attitude could be experienced by the enslaved as a reduction of humanity to objectification. Further, as we have seen througout the semester already, the institution of slavery develops in the South within the context of a broader political tradition of liberty which develops in medeival England and comes to a full flowering in the American revolution and its aftermath in the US context. Thus, the institution the slaveholders create is one rife with tension and even contradiction: a system that demands maximized labor productivity (and thus opens itself up for egregious abuse) is also one in which the slaveholder needs to see himself as someone who treats his slaves with humanity and who also needs to navigate the contradictions between his own slaveholding and his own ideas of liberty. In a different book, Genovese will call this tension "the slaveholders' dilemma."
--SLAVERY AS TRANSITION BETWEEN PEASANTRY AND INDUSTRIALISM Slaveholding in the antebellum era--that is, between the 1820s and 60s, when the cotton kingdom reaches its apex--is caught in a transitional era. It is an essentially premodern, peasant-style labor system being done in an era of massive industrialaization, where agriculture is in a symbiotic relationship with industry. As such, Southern slavery must utilize a peasant laboring practice--crops grown by hand; there are no agricultural machines or chemicals at this point, no tractors, no combines, no chemical fertilzers, no chemical pesticides or herbicides--and exercise it at industrial scale. Northern industry demands Southern agricultural commodities, *particulary* cotton, produced at mass scale, a scale that could have only been achieved by methods that required an "industrialization" of a peasant practice. How do these demands get met? These pressures lead to the development of the reward/punishment system, to be considered momentarily. 

CONCEPTIONS OF LABOR
--This tension between pre-modern peasantry and industrializing modernity also plays into how labor is understood in this era. It is in this antebellum era that the idea of the South as a "lazy" region with a "slower pace of life" develops. This is developing against the background of larger seismic changes around labor and cultural changes in how labor is understood that are occuring throughout the Western world; such changes are occuring in Europe as well as in the Americas.
--First, we must understand what traditional peasant labor is like and how it has been practiced globally. Peasant labor (define what we mean) is not easy by any means, but the work itself is not *regular*. The natural rythms of the agricultural world mean that work will be irregular. There will be times in which there will be little work to be done (think through examples) while at other times there will be massive amounts of work to be done. This work will also almost always be done in community, and the success of the labor measured communally. Industrial labor, in the meantime, is very different: it is measured by the clock, it is regular, and it is individualized. That is, "hard work" is, under the labor conditions of industry, understood as doing specific, regular tasks at defined intervals repetively, and success is measured individually--that is, you are evaluated on how well *your* assigned tasks are done by *you*.  Many Northern Europeans (and their cousins in the Western hemisphere), operating under an idea of industrialization, are increasingly judging those with whom they are interacting from non-or-less-industrialized parts of the world as "lazy" because they are not operating with a the same view of labor. Thus, we see the English complaining of Irish laziness, Americans traveling in Argentina and Italy shocked by the perceived indolence of Latino and Mediterrean peoples, New Englanders looking at the Southern planter as a merely a playboy sitting on his veranda in a seersucker suit sipping a mint julep--all because the economic contexts of those places, shaped by geography and climate on the one hand (the South, the Mediterraean world, Latin America) and politics on the other (Ireland) situates those places and peoples in an economy that is still largely preindustrial or, in the case of the South, a strange hybrid of preindustiral peasantry and industrial production.
--White Southerners do two things with this labor situation. With regards to themselves, they wear their "laziness" as a badge of pride. To be clear, they were *not* lazy. The evidence is overwhelmingly that the average plantation owner was just as detailed a record keeper and meticulous a manager of resources and labor as any Nothern capitalist. Yet, they conscientiously saw themselves as seperate from the "money-grubbing" rapacious Northern capitalist. The reasons for doing this were myriad. First, this allowed Southerners to lean into ideas of substantial differences betweent the regions; of course, these differences were real and have cultural, political, and economic sources. But as the regions increasingly vyed for political power within the context of Union (we saw this with Calhoun), cultural differences became ever more pronounced. Further, the opening of the West over the previous generation or two meant that North and South were in open competition, both politically and culturally, for who would shape the emergence of this new region. As we discussed with Simms a few weeks ago, we see the South thus becoming a cultural ideal that both North and South exploited to help make sense of what America meant--it was either a savage place or a place of gentility and culture, a place to be emulated or to see as everything that's wrong with the world. Second, Southerners could point to their "laziness"--in their mind, their paternalistic treatment of their enslaved laborers--as distinct from Northern capitalists driving their wage-earning industrial workers into ground, allowing them to make a defense of slavery as a more "humane" labor system than industrialized wage-earning labor, a defense that, as we have seen, both economic need and political exigencies (think of Calhoun's idea of tying the interests of the South together *via* slavery as a means of creating a political block that could stand for the tradtional principles of Jeffersonian republicanism, which were increasingly threatened). It is undeniably true that workers in Northern factories were laboring in often inhumane and vile conditions; pro-slavery apologists in the South pointed to this and thus wore their "laziness" as a badge of pride.
--However, slaveholders themselves brought these ideas of "laziness" to bear on their black slaves, as well. This is complemented by the emergence of so-called "scientific" understandigns of race that were emerging at this time; Sotuhern slaveholders' understanding of black laziness feeds into their understanding of Blackness/black inferiority, which is in many ways parallel to how Northern Europeans saw the Irish and Latin peoples. Much of the rhetoric of black laziness put forth by Southern slaveholders has echoes in the North about Irish and, later, Italian immigrants, which takes on a similarly racist tone amongst Northerners. Slaveholders in the South were essentially controlling a laboring peasantry but trying to get them to operate under industrial conditions and produce commodities at a scale that met industrialized demands. The tension, even the contradiction, is obvious.
--White complaints of black laziness are belied by white observations in other contexts of how amazingly hard blacks worked; things like hog-killing, sugar cane-grinding, and corn-shucking times--moments when massive amounts of labor would be done efficiently and in an orderly fashion are regulary described in primary source accounts of the era. Accordign to WEB DuBois, enslaved Blacks operated in the logic of peasant labor, responding well to situations where mass amounts of labor needed to be done and where there were *communal experiences and benefits that went along with it*. These times were the times when masters would shower their slaves with gifts and positive rewards (which, in turn, allowed masters to see themselves as benign paternalists). Yet times outisde of these, when masters tried to force enslaved workers into laboring under the logic of industry in contexts that were nevertheless not within industrial contexts, it was punishment--whippings and the like--which masters used to try to drive their slaves.

Thus, ideas of labor--tied to economics and culture--help to drive the tensions inherent to the system. How is this tension navigated? We have to look at this through both black and white eyes. Masters see themselves as benign paternalists treating thier slaves--whom they often think of as "our people", note the emphasis on something familial there!--well, using the gifts and rewards of the harvest season to justify this; they put forth ideas of liberty while seeing their slaves as incapable of liberty and thus needing paternal protection, convince themselves that liberty will make the slave miserable. Slaves, meanwhile, intuit the master's liberal worldview and the contradictions in it that his very enslavement manifests. He makes demands on the slaveholders, seeing "his white folks" as having obligations to him, that "his white folks" owe him some kind of vision of liberty, some kind of understanding of himself-as-an-individual. Many scholars, like Genovese in particular, note that black navigation of things like labor expected of him, endurance of punishments, flaunting expectations by the white folks, etc. are moments of resistance from *within* the system that serve as enslaved blacks' means of pointing out the contradictions of the system to their slaveholders, while things like hard work during communal times--harvest time and the like--are not so much expressions of appreciation to "their white folks" for gifts and rewards. The songs recorded as having been regularly sung at these events are immensely transgressive and thus undermine such an idea of acceptance and instead point out the ways in which these very times of rewards and gifts were evidence of white slaveholders' recognition of their "dilemma". Instead, these are opportunities for communal protection, bonding, and deepening of socio-cultural ties.

We now come to Douglass, whose work illustrates the perspective of an exceptionally intelligent black man who has worked out much of these tensions on this own, who is pointing them out to the slaveholding class and whites in general; beyond this, he is also positioning Southern slaveholding into a more broadly American and international framework and, in so doing, articulating this as not a peculiary Southern or even political problem, but rather one of universal ideas of humanity and the particularly egregious violation of these against one group of human beings: Southern Blacks.
