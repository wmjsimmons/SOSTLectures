From David Hackett Fischer
--Scotch-Irish settlement; the problem of that name/term. "Borderlanders"? The context on the other side of the Atlantic. 
--Arrival in PA and being pushed out; 633.
--The nature of the Borderlanders' settlement of the Southern interior and their contributions to the development of a distinctive Southern culture; pay especial attention to their notion of liberty and how to understand/make sense of it.
Characteristics 
--Cultural conservatism (not ideological, but based in fierce loyalty to the old ways. 651
--Extended notions of kinship; ideal of hospitality for family and friends (often defined quite loosely and broadly) but incredible wariness of strangers. Not this is not so much an ethnic cultural characteristic as one connected to the broader experiences of marginalized peoples all over the world and throughout history! Yet, these ancestral ways shape the cultural expectations and presuppositions of the Scots-Irish and continue to govern how they understand community/hospitality even after they and their descendants gain cultural and economic power.
--This itself connected to notions of land, once again. These individuals came from places where their land ownership was limited and where they were often subjected to control by others. In the Southern backcountry, they find themselves free of much of the social control of Britain, but still in many cases unable to hold land itself. While a sizable Scots-Irish yeomanry and even a small elite group of large landholders were present in the Southern backcountry, the majority of 18th century Scots-Irish settlers were landless peasants who owned only their labor and tools, animals, etc. This great inequality of land ownership amongst backcountry whites persists well into the 19th, and even the 20th, centuries. (note why this does not result in class conflict, however)
--Liberty for the borderlanders, 754-55, 772-773; a dedication to personal rule, to the familiar, to the great man who could prove himself by his greatness, strength, swagger. This idea of the worth of the self, filtered through a politics of the personal rather than the abstract vision of ideals, manifests in how they conceive of liberty--as 'natural freedom.' pg 777.
--The Scots-Irish idea of natural freedom, a non-ideological adherence liberty, self-pride, suspicion of outsiders, a politics of great leaders rather htan principles--these in tension and sometimes outright conflict with elite, more "English" ideals of aristocratic leadership, political principles/the rule of law, a liberty of protecting self-interest (particularly economic self-interest), etc.  Conflicts and socio-political tensions between the Backcountry and Plantation Belt a constant in Southern history; connect this again to land--the Fall Line again.

Thus, the Colonial South a place of at least four distinct groups, in a complex relationship of alliance and enemies, of shared ideals and notions and vehement disagreement, with varying gradations of power and yet often with real initmacy amongst each another: high status whites, typically English with some German, Swiss, and French, mostly east of the Fall Line; low status whites, typically Scots-Irish/Borderlander with some German, mostly west of the Fall Line; enslaved blacks, mostly east of the fall line (though, with Scots-Irish settlement of hte interior, a steady drip into the Southern backcountry with mass movement into Mississippi and Alabama in the early 19th century); Native Americaans, by the mid-1700s almost totally shoved west of the Fall Line, with complex shifting alliances as they deal with centuries-old rivalries and politics amongst themselves on the one hand and dealing with conflicts over land with whites and, in a different way, blacks (though still small in number because of the relatively low populations of Native Americans, Native people, particulary in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, regularly owned African slaves).

Coclanis; the idea of mercantalism. Background of Barbados, several decades older than Carolina. The economic needs of Barbadian settlers and the change of Carolina's trajectory. Connection with the architectural development of the place, per Coclanis' introduction. 

-James Glen (1701-1777); royal governor of South Carolina (1738 appointed, didn't arrive in Charleston until 1743, recalled from his governorship in 1756, he nevertheless remains in Charleston until 1761. He returns home to Scotland and lives out his days there, but keeps in contact with Charleston, investing in a plantation and keeping cordial relations with influential Charlestonians). His book published in 1749.
--pg 3, the borderlanders and the boundary dispute between NC and SC--connection to borderlander sense of liberty, sense of tensions between the sections (cf. the birthplace of Andrew Jackson, the great borderlander in so many ways)
--pg 4, the Indians and the relations between them and the British settlers
--pp. 6 and 8, the land and its connection to labor; the land explained by and through how much a single slave can produce
--pg. 9, more of the above, but also the connection of indigo to the "sugar islands" and the reality of Carolina's long connection to the Carribbean; remember Eliza Pinckney responsible for bringing this to Carolina.
--pg 10, more on labor; the tidy economic logic and the effective management of resources, etc.
--pg 38; population--note that Glen dicusses how to grow the population (38-39). Keep in mind what Colcanis notes: until the 1770s, disease made the population very unstable in the Lowcountry and thus a constant need for immigration, both black and white.  The disease world of colonial SC devastated both white and black (with the black fairing better, but still suffering mightily). However, those born and reared in SC tended to fair much better in this climate and disease world than those who had to come and thus needed "seasoning"; this was the case for both black and white. Daniel Littlefield makes the case that Carolina-born slaves were eventually more valuable and desirable than imported Africans because of this fact (as well as a reduced worry about the chaos and violence that was feared by slaves remaining culturally "other"). Eventually, a tipping point is reached and natural population growth becomes steady. Charleston becomes a significant city by the late 18th century. By some measures, in the antebellum era it is the wealthiest city in America, and yet, even at its height, it remains small in comparison to the massive urban centers of Philadelphia and New York; the world of disease thus always limits to what extent colonial Charleston--and thus the Lowcountry and South Carolina in general--can grow.
--But not that Glen talks about law and liberty as a means by which to attract new immigation, see section V.
--pg 32; the limits of executive power built into the legal order of colonial SC, this likely both a response and a contributing factor to the pursuit of self-interested liberty as the driving factor of SC politics of this era (and beyond?)
--pp 32-33; the uneveness of representation, a holdover from the anti-democratic character of the Fundamental Constitutions and a source of tension that would endure in SC politics into the late 19th century, and that still has echoes in our own day.
