Much could be said of John C. Calhoun--much more than we have time to say today. What I hope to do today is to point out the most significant parts of his political philosophy, those parts that will have enduring consequences for the South up until secession (and even after the defeat of the Confederacy). What is his central question? What are the central tenants of his political philosophy? How do his practical politics develop and evolve? Do they divert from his core concerns and ideas, his foundational principles? How do these manifest in the Ft. Hill address? Finally, what are the consequences of his thought moving forward--even to our own day?

Before that though, we must confront the elephant in the room: that there are two ways to read Calhoun, each of which possibly insulated from the other, but we need must hold them together. For some, Calhoun is simply a theorist of the defense of a system of the chattel ownership of other human beings and a promoter of views of race that put peoples of African descent far below that of European-derived peoples, thus legimating their subjugation and their (often brutal) maltreatment, something with consequences many argue we continue to feel down unto our own day. In this reading, there is no getting outside of Calhoun the brutalizing White supremacist; he deserves no honor, no consideration, and should simply be scorned by all decent people. There is another reading, of Calhoun the theorist of minority rights, Calhoun the constitutional theorist, Calhoun who attempts to understand the relationships of the part to the whole in a democratic society. This view often overlooks the first view, decrying it, whether openly or subconsciously, as, at best, missing the forest for the trees. Which should it be, then?

I don't think we can seperate the two. Yes, Calhoun's political thought arises from his advocacy of the rights of an elite, slaveholding class of White Southerners in the face of threats to their socioeconomic order. Thus, in a very real way, we cannot seperate Calhoun's political thought from slavery; the development of his ideas would likely have not arisen if he had not been from a state that felt threats to the inseperable pillars of export-focused commodity agriculture and Black chattel slavery and he felt the need to defend the interests of his state from the sociopolitical and economic forces, like the tariffs of the 1820s and 30s, that seemed poised to destroy them. Further, Calhoun was shaped by the same Revolutionary-era rhetoric that pitted liberty against slavery that consumed and tied into knots the previous generation of American statesmen. He recognized the tension that they had seen and yet, unlike them, he explained it away, making slavery not a tension within the American ideal of liberty, but rather something that could exist comfortably within it. In these ways, we cannot ignore the connections of Calhoun's thought to slavery. And yet, this connection should not preclude us from taking seriously Calhoun's constitutional theories for, in fact, the theories transcend the contexts in which they were written. We see this with Calhoun's most significant idea, the so-called "concurrent majority" (which we do not consider today) being used in various and intriguing ways in the late 20th century.

For instance, in the late 1970s, the Dutch political scientist Arend Lipjhart drew directly on Calhoun's thought to ask how democracies deeply divided into ethnic, religious, racial, linguistic, or other factions can survive while giving respectful place to all factions within that democratic union. Lipjhart's work, drawing directly on Calhoun, found two eager audiences: Northern Ireland, where a centuries-long struggle between Irish Nationalist Catholics and Protestant citizens loyal to the English monarch had erupted into terrorism and tit-for-tat violence; and South Africa, where the aparthied regime was in slow-motion collapse and ideas of how to share power--and avoid the inter-ethnic bloodletting that had already and would continue to haunt east Africa in the late 20th century--were at the forefront. While South Africa's black-majority constitution rejected the Calhoun-derived ideas of Lipjhart, Northern Ireland embraced them in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Further, the 1990s saw some Black scholars in the US, such as UPenn Law Professor Lani Guiner, putting forth Calhoun-derived proposals for protecting the rights of racial and ethnic minorities within a US democracy that many Black activists felt (and continue to feel) systematically ignores their concerns. To say Prof. Guiner is explicitly citing Calhoun is not accurate, but her late 20th-century proposals for increasing the voices of peoples of color and other historically marginalized groups loudly echo the proposals Calhoun made in defense of another, very different minority interest group: elite slaveholding Whites in the antebellum South. Thus, we cannot dismiss Calhoun's thought as simply and straightforwardly as some might like us to; we have to contend with its central question, how that question shapes, and even makes reasonable, the thinking of the antebellum South, and continues to be with us unto our own day, with our myriad factions and interest groups in an America that seems, in its own way, to be splitting along lines of group loyalty and self-interest.

What, then, is the central question of Calhoun's Constitutional theory? This question is not the same as asking what his foundational political principles are, but knowing this question, it is easy to work back to his foundational political principles. For Calhoun, the central question of his Constitutional theory is this: acknowledging the realtiy that, in a diverse, dispersed, large, heterogenous republic in which tensions between the various parts of that union will often and regularly be in conflict, *who adjudicates the disagreements between the central government and these various, often factional, interests?* For Calhoun, Madison's idea put forth in Federalist 10--that a dispersed republic would lessen the impact of faction, making factions weaker and increasing common cause amongst them--had long ago been proven wrong, something arguably even Madison recognizes in the Virginia Resolutions of 1798. If varied, conflicting interests that form into factions are an inescapable part of a country like the United States, and if the United States is to have a strong central government (an idea Calhoun supported and even saw as necessary), then who is to be the referee when conflicts between these interests and the sections arise, a question that the increased seriousness of sectional conflict and partisan politcs of the 1830s and 40s makes all the more alarming. For many of Calhoun's day, this answer was the Supreme Court, per Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution [examine that; note the problems that someone like Calhoun would have seen here].

If not SCOTUS, then who? We can say that hte central gov't is supreme, of course, overruling the faction. This an idea that many of Calhoun's day, like Daniel Webster of Massachusetts, would put forth, arguing that the Constiution gave the general government over all, because it constituted the US as a democratic nation representing all the people of the US *in aggregate,* thus meaning that the general gov't rules for all, overruling a factional interest in the service of protecting the liberties of all. Of course, for others, this reads as tyrannical, a situation where 50% of voters plus one can dominate and assault the liberties of the minority. If liberty is to have any meaning, it must exist to protect the lbierty of all (obvious ironic position of enslaved Blacks of course). Thus, for those like Calhoun, drawing on the republican principles of '98 (though Calhoun was not a doctrinaire Tertium Quid, far from it, and he would regularly depart from the republican orthodoxy of somone like John Randolph of Roanoke), another solution needed to be in order. Calhoun's answer to the question of who adjudicates such conflicts between the general government and factional interests is the states, for, in his understanding of the Constitution, the US is not a centralized, consolidated nation, but a federated compact of sovereign states who voluntarily came together for mutual benefit and mutual protection of liberty. In this view, it is the states that are anterior to the union and that constituted it, rather than the union that created the states. As we have seen, this is widely, if not universally, held position at the time of the drafting of the Constitution and is not directly dependent on ideas of enslaved labor as a socio-economic system. If the general government is the constitutive aggregate of the states giving up of some parts of their power, then it follows that they can adjudicate conflicts between the general government and the people.

Another way to say this: Calhoun is interested in the question of how we preserve liberty for minority interests in a pluralist, heterogenous democratic republic when those interests will inevitably sometimes be in coflict with the policies of the general government, informed and shaped by the minority. His answer is that the states can adjudicate such conflicts via standing between the two parties. This is the idea of interpostion, which its opponents would acidly decry by labeling it as "nullifcation." Representing the interests of a slaveholding elite minority Calhoun may have been, his question is no less significant and transcends the the racial aspects of *his particular asking of it*. 

But where does this question come from? What are Calhoun's foundational political principles? How does they and his central question help us to understand the seeming contradiciton at the heart of his political evolution from nationalist war hawk in the 1810s to the intellectual godfather of Southern secession? Finally, what are the key contexts and aspects of the Ft. Hill address, which we read for today?

--Background to this question: At its core, Calhoun's politics are the Jeffersonian Principles of '98--decentralization, states rights, the states as antecedent to the nation. However, Calhoun in many ways lacks Jefferson's constitutional scruples. While Jefferson knew the LA purchase was unconstitutional, he did it anyway in pursuit of a deeper goal that spoke to his foundational principles. Nevertheless, Jefferson reamined a strict constructionist. Calhoun, to the contrary, does not see the meaning of the Constitution as unchangable; to him, the constitution exists to serve the interests of the present. Calhoun's constitutionalism thus an intriguing mix of Jeffersonian conservatism and progressive revisionism. This makes sense when we understand his background.

Calhoun's borderlander contexts and family/SC background; the upstate changed during Calhoun's boyhood as the cotton kingdom opens up and brings massive wealth west of the Fall Line, enriching many yeomen (like his family) to planter status. Calhoun thus represents a world shaped by the fierce independence and honor culture of the Scots-Irish and their innate distrust of centralized power and privilege, one at the same time that is coming into wealth and privilege itself in a way that echoes what's down on the coast. He thus is a product of two worlds being molded into a coherent entitty. His education similary shows this duality in his thinking. Educated at private academy in Williston, SC under a Moses Waddell, a man steeped in republican principles, he would then go to Yale, a hotbed of Federalist thought, as well as study law in CT at one of the first "scientific" law schools in the country, one run by a Federalist-sympathetic lawyer who nevertheless taught his students to see all sides on a isssue. Calhoun's background is thus of existing in a blending of two worlds, and this blending shapes how he understands politics. 

--Calhoun's Political Principles
Calhoun is always a Unionist; that is, he firmly believes in the good of union. But for Calhoun, Union is not good in and of itself, it is good because it protects the interests of its many and diverse interests (Elder, pg94). Union necessarily dependent upon strength, and a strong union is made strong because it protects the varied interests of its people. For Calhoun, a nation is always a place of united, if disparate, interests, bound together for mutual protection and with a strong sense of shared honor. To violate the honor of one section or interests, or to protect one section or interest over and above others, is a means of *disunion,* invariably. For Calhoun, an active nation and a strong central government are good things, inasmuch as they bind together the nation's disparate interests in mutuallyl protective and beneficial ways, not dishonoring any section or marginalzing any interest.

Calhoun's background and its marrying together of differences shapes everything about how he sees America; it is a place of inescapable differences, yet bound together with a shared sense of national honor and pride. His advocacy of the War of 1812 must be seen through this, as he is respoding to, in his mind, an insult to national pride. But the pride of nation is inseperable from the pride of section and, especially, state. The honor of each state must be represented and defended; to violate the honor of a state is to undermine the very idea of union because, for Calhoun like Jefferson before him, the states are anterior to the Union--that is, the *states* create the union, and thus the union should be constituted to safeguard the states, not the other way around. Unlike his sometimes friend and othertimes rival John Quincy Adams--as well as some other Northern voices--who saw the birth of the nation in Jefferson's florid call to universal freedom and "self-evident" human rights in the Declaration, for Calhoun and many Southerners (Jefferson included), America was not an idea, but rather a contracted joining together of disparate political communities, each with their own cultures and interests, in order to have those disparate political communities (which we call states) protected, their honor upheld, and their sovereignty assumed.

In summary, Calhoun always sees America as a productive tension bteween state and federal power; his theories a means by which that power-sharing should be condified to preserve a liberty-protecting union for all. He is ultmiately asking *what is America to be? a compacted federation or a centralized nation?* Over the course of his career, Calhoun moves from trying to thread both of these together to, as circumstances change, someone seeking how to make the compacted federation function, while never denying that union is a prerequisite for the survival of the compact.


--Political evolution
Calhoun's political career, from his early nationalism in the House to his sectional advocacy in the Senate in the 1830s and 40s, must be seen through this lens. There's a lazy interpretation of Calhoun that sees him as contradicting himself when it becomes expedient for the slaveholding South to no longer embrace nationalism, but that's not correct. Calhoun's core principle--of nation as a place of united disparate interests that serves to uphold, defend, and protect those interests--remains throughout the evolution of his practical politics. He is not the doctrinaire adherent to abstract ideas of the Constitution and strict constructionism like John Randolph of Roanoke and the Tertium Quids, with whom he regulary sparred in the 1810s and 20s. The constitution could, and even should, be reinterpreted in changing circumstances, but its core purpose remains the same: to make a strong nation that can protect, defend, and honor the disparate interests of a vast and heterogenous republic. A strong nation is needed to serve all of those functions. Thus, his advocacy of infrastructure and tariffs in his nationlist era during his career in the House, the Cabinet of James Monroe, and during some of the Vice Presidendcy of JQA. Yet, when nation ceases to balance these interests and rather puts the finger on the scale in favor of one set of interests above others, Calhoun turns sectionalist, as we see in his second VP run under Jackson and his time in the Senate in the 1830s and 40s. His core ideas are unchanged--the contexts change. And, importantly, because the states are anterior to union, it logically serves that loyalty must be first *to the states*, not to the union, which exists only because of the states.

Calhoun's own evolution must be seen thus in the evolution of South Carolina itself, an evolution away from nationalism to states rights put forth by the post-1819 economic weakening; the growth of cotton-production in Alabama and Mississippi huring the prices of cotton and slaves in SC; and newly percieved threats to slavery (and whenever there were worries abotu slavery, there were also worries of social chaos) emerging from the MO Compromise, Ohio's ending of slavery, England abolishing the slave trade in its empire, Haiti's existence as a republic violently created out of the ashes of slavery, and Simon Bolivar's revolutionary work in South America that also ended slavery. Slavery was on the outs all over the world, but the South generally and SC particulary saw no way out of it without absolute social chaos and bloodshed (as the revolutions in Haiti and South America clearly illustrated in their minds), as well as a mass economic immisertion. Further, the rise of protective tariffs that many South Carolinians saw as hurt the South's economic prospects further pushed them away from nationalism. As the state evolved, many important voices in SC, such as Thomas Cooper of South Carolina College, were increasingly critical of Calhoun's nationalist positions. So yes, he evolved his stance in response to the political presssures of the day but, again, this itself does not alter his core principles.

--Ft Hill address; background contexts and key aspects.
In the early 1830s, Calhoun was in the midst of his second term as Vice President. He had been a candidate for POTUS in the complex race in 1824 that had no clear winner after the votes were cast, with the election thrown to the House of Representatives under the rules of the 12th amendment. When all was said and done, he had been made VP under his JQA, a sometime friend and sometime rival. Calhoun and Andrew Jackson, the embittered loser of the '24 election, saw each other as allies, and 1828 had the odd situation of a sitting VP as the running mate of the rival for the presidency; Jackson and Calhoun win in dominant fashion. However strong their administration looked, it was scandal-plagued, with a snub by Calhoun's wife of another society lady angering Jackson (yes, that happened, it's complicated). When an unknown political rival (maybe JQA) leaked correspondence from 1818, when Calhoun was secretary of war under President Monroe, correspondence that showed that Calhoun had decried Jackson's defying orders from Washington when he was general in the Seminole Wars, something that had been rumored years before and that Calhoun always papered over by talking of mere "misunderstandings" between then-Gen. Jackson and the wishes of President Monroe's administration. Increasingly alienated from the POTUS personally, Calhoun comes to feel the same alarm that his fellow South Carolinians feel about proposed tariff legislation supported by Jackson and many mid-atlantic and Northern politicians. Much of the South and some of the West, but SC in particular, feel these tarriffs as a threat to free trade and their economic interests. The government, in their view, has gone beyond the consitutionally-permissible use of tarrifs to raise revenues for the mutual benefit of all Americans, but has rather placed its finger on the scales, making some economic sectors--manufacturing and shipping--more important than others, particularly agricultural commodity production. Economists in the late 20th century largely have agreed with this part of SC's complaint; indeed, the tariff did benefit the economy of the North at the expense of the South, even while, many economists point out, Northern manufacturing would have been competitive on the free market in direct competition with European-produced goods, thus suggesting that the tariff did little *protective* good while alienating the South. 

With the percieved attack on the South's economy is also a percieved attack against slavery, upon which the South's economic system is based. Combined with the increasing sense of political marginalization and the doubling-down on slavery as a means by which to ensure political parity with the North in the aftermath of the Missouri Compromise, the tarrif led SC, and many others across the South, to fear a colonial domination of themselves by the North. Rhetoric echoing the resistance of the 13 colonies to Great Britain 50 years before became common.

It is in this context that Calhoun had already written an anonymous pamphlet called The South Carolina Exposition decrying the tarrif. As political pressure turned up, and as his authorship of the Exposition became more widely known, Calhoun retreats to his study at Ft Hill (now Clemson's campus) to write the Ft Hill Address, the first full statement of his constitutional theory, to be published in a newspaper in nearby Pendleton and from there to be distributed widely.

Core ideas:
--states precede the general government
--states are "distinct political communities"
--the constitution, which creates the general government, a "compact, to which each State is a party."
--The constitution and the general government thus no more erases the soveriegn nature of the states any more than two men entering into business with one another erases either man.
--As parties to the compact/contract, the states are the judges of its violation
--Constitutions should restrain governments, regulation what they can and cannot do, as laws tell citizens the same. Simple majoritarianism does not override the constitutional circumscription of governmental ability--just because a majority of citizens may want the government to do something, that does not mean that it *can* do that thing if a constitution does not permit it. To say this can happen is to make a constitution of no effect and to make the effective principle of governance the whims of a simple majority of the people, with no regard for the different desires and interests of substantial other groups of citizens in the minority. *Majority rule IS good and right and to be praised, BUT IT CANNOT BE ABSOLUTE* Governmental authority must procede from the assent more than just some faction of the population.
--Constitutions *should* preserve the equality before the law of all factions in a republic, no matter their dissimilar interests. When a government begins to pick winners and losers among those factions of dissimilar interest, it begins to threaten the very constitutional order itself, thereby threatening the free exercise of liberty  in agregate.
--how do we avoid the inevitable difference in interests? We can't. But we can make constitutions that ensure the rights and liberties of all the various political communities with different interests. That, to Calhoun, is what we in the US have. but should the central government override its constitutional borders, it is the *duty*--not just the privilege, but the duty--of the states to interpose, to nullify the unconstitutional actions within its borders, so as to protect the interests of its citizens which are now being threatened. 
--In this view, we have our first and primary citizenry in our states; our belonging to America as citizens grows out of our states, not the other way around. The states are not just arbitrary lines on maps or simple economic regions, but themselves distinct sociopolitical cultures that must be protected, with differing interests that must be respected. 
--Interposition/nullfication thus a means by which the citizens are protected from usurpations of their liberty and in which the Contsititutional order, meant to defend all, is upheld so that it *can* defend all. State interposition thus a means by which the constituion can be preserved as a vehicle for ensuring the liberty for all citizens by precluding it from being a means by which special interests or factions can overrun the rights of others.

While Calhoun is, as noted at the outset, writing this from a perspective to defend the rights of Southern slaveholders and their economic interests--and thus also their ownership of slaves--let us put this into a contemporary situation.What if, under a DeSantis presidency, strict national legislation regulating abortion and LGBT issues was put in place. Under a Calhounite framework, CA, MA, NY, and IL may choose to interpose between the federal government and their citizens, nullifying these laws' effects in their states. Recognizing the consequences of such nullifcation, this imagined DeSantis admin may not pursue these policies, or may pursue a significantly relaxed version thereof. We see then how Calhoun's idea may work out in even a progressive context, because they, at their core, ask how can governments represent the desires and interests of their consitutents while recognizing that they must also govern for all those who oppose their policies. Calhoun later develops these ideas more fully in two massive tomes, The Discourse and the Disquisition, that formulate a complex theory of power sharing between what he calls "concurrent majorities," ensuring power is shared bewtween different factions/interst groups. There is, for him, simply no other way to ensure the survival of a vast, diverse, heterogenous republic without coercion and making some peoples more free than others (irony, of course, in this).
